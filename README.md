# dysonMqtt
this project helped me to fetch mqtt data to/from the dyson air purifier mqtt broker.

the above code does the next things:
1. subscrbe to events from the dyson mqtt broker and save the returned data on json files + to other mqtt broker (HA for smart home applications)
2. send the dyson operetional commands (turn on\off, fan speed, rotate... etc)
